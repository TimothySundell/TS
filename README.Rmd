TS was written to improve the quality of life for its creator, maybe it can help you as well?

It contains a collection of functions that may be relevant people analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and analysing Ig(BCR)/TCR-sequences. 

**Please** give our method article a look at the **DOI** button above.
It shows the importance of removing BCR/TCR genes prior to performing unsupervised clustering and downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data containing lymphocytes.

You can find a reference webpage [*here*](https://timothysundell.github.io/TS/), or under the *About* section in the top right corner of this webpage.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the TS package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("TimothySundell/TS")
```

***

## Comments from the author

My plan is to keep this repository updated as much as possible. 
If something is not working, please post in the *Issues* section.

As of now, the package does not pass *R CMD CHECK* as the tidyverse way of coding leaves me a lot of unlinked global variables to reference.
Will maybe be fixed in the future.

***

## The TS collection of functions can be divided into 4 main categories:

- Functions for plotting figures
- Functions for analysing sc-V(D)J-sequencing data
- Functions for analysing scRNA-seq data
- General data-wrangling
